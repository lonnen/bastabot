  "readme": "NodeJS IRC client library\n=========================\n\nHow to get it\n-------------\n\nThe easiest way to get it is via [npm][]\n\n    npm install irc\n\nIf you want to run the latest version (i.e. later than the version available\nvia [npm][]) you can clone this repo, then use [npm][] to link-install it:\n\n    npm link /path/to/your/clone\n\nOf course, you can just clone this, and manually point at the library itself,\nbut I really recommend using [npm][]!\n\nHow to use it\n-------------\n\nThis library provides basic IRC client functionality. In the simplest case you\ncan connect to an IRC server like so:\n\n    var irc = require('irc');\n    var client = new irc.Client('irc.dollyfish.net.nz', 'myNick', {\n        channels: ['#blah'],\n    });\n\nOf course it's not much use once it's connected if that's all you have!\n\nThe client emits a large number of events that correlate to things you'd\nnormally see in your favourite IRC client. Most likely the first one you'll\nwant to use is:\n\n    client.addListener('message', function (from, to, message) {\n        sys.puts(from + ' => ' + to + ': ' + message);\n    });\n\nor if you're only interested in messages to the bot itself:\n\n    client.addListener('pm', function (from, message) {\n        sys.puts(from + ' => ME: ' + message);\n    });\n\nor to a particular channel:\n\n    client.addListener('message#yourchannel', function (from, message) {\n        sys.puts(from + ' => #yourchannel: ' + message);\n    });\n\nAt the moment there are functions for joining:\n\n    client.join('#yourchannel');\n\nparting:\n\n    client.part('#yourchannel');\n\nand talking:\n\n    client.say('#yourchannel', 'I'm a bot!');\n\nFor any other commands you might want to send to the server you can use the\nsend() message which sends raw messages to the server:\n\n    client.send('MODE', '#yourchannel', '+o', 'yournick');\n\nAll commands and events are documented in `API.md` (hopefully). I hope to make\na more complete set of events/commands over the next few weeks.\n\n[npm]: http://github.com/isaacs/npm\n",
